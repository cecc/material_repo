<p>Career Development Services via its Civic Engagement programs is proposing to create a prototype comprehensive website that will link 10-15 community partners to improve the distribution of hunger prevention information to families and communities in need in the greater Newark area.</p>


<p>We have learned from our partnership with many of you that the greater Newark area is home to many disadvantaged families who can benefit from the services that you offer, but they have no means to access the information.  We want to help.  As a result of a grant from the Wakefern Foundation we will be able to facilitate this process by connecting agencies and communities via the web. </p> 

<p>A team of NJIT student volunteers in the Civic Engagement Computer Center will create this template website that can be integrated into the partner agenciesâ€™ websites for the purpose of hunger prevention awareness at no cost to the agency. We will have a demonstration for you as to how this will all work. </p>
